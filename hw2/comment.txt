PARSING
multithreading and multiprocessing gave much better results than synchronous calculation
main time is spent on http request, consequently it becomes more effective when it does not wait for response
however it as well makes it volatile, because http request can take varied time
multiprocessing did not give any advantage because only small part of calculation is made

CALCULATION
synch, multithreading, async gave almost the same result, calculation doesn't have any waiting for results of others, sleeping etc. Consequently, parallelism doesn't give any advantage and perform as synch.
in image calculation.png you can see that when calculation is light multiprocessing even worse than others because it spends time on creating new process
in image calculation_2.png you can see that when calculation is heavy multiprocessing can give advantage of performing calculation on several cores at the same time
